    <h1>Disadvantages of HTML</h1>
        <li>It cannot produce dynamic output alone, since it’s a static language.</li>
        <li>Making the structure of HTML documents becomes tough to understand.</li>
        <li>Errors can be costly.</li>
        <li>It is the time consuming as the time it consume to maintain on the colour scheme of a page and to make lists, tables and forms.</li>
        <li>It can create only static and plain pages so if we’d like dynamic pages then HTML isn’t useful.</li>
        <li>Required to write a lot of code for just creating a simple webpage.</li>
        <li>We have to check up the deprecated tags and confirm not to use them to appear because another language that works with HTML has replaced the first work of the tag, and hence the opposite language needs to be understood and learned.</li>
        <li>Security features offered by HTML are limited.</li>
        <li>If we need to write down long code for creating a webpage then it produces some complexity.</li>
