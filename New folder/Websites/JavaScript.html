    <h1>Advantages of JavaScript</h1>
        <li>Speed. Client-side JavaScript is very fast because it can be run immediately within the client-side browser. Unless outside resources are required, JavaScript is unhindered by network calls to a backend server.</li>
        <li>Simplicity. JavaScript is relatively simple to learn and implement.</li>
        <li>Popularity. JavaScript is used everywhere on the web.</li>
        <li>Interoperability. JavaScript plays nicely with other languages and can be used in a huge variety of applications.</li>
        <li>Server Load. Being client-side reduces the demand on the website server.</li>
        <li>Gives the ability to create rich interfaces.</li>

    <h1>Disadvantages of JavaScript</h1>
        <li>Client-Side Security. Because the code executes on the usersâ€™ computer, in some cases it can be exploited for malicious purposes. This is one reason some people choose to disable Javascript.</li>
        <li>Browser Support. JavaScript is sometimes interpreted differently by different browsers. This makes it somewhat difficult to write cross-browser code.</li>
