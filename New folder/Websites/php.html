        <li>It is more stable from a few years with assistance of providing continuous support to various versions. </li>
        <li>It helps in reusing an equivalent code and no got to write lengthy code and sophisticated structure for event of web applications.</li> 
        <li>It helps in managing code easily. </li>
        <li>It has powerful library support to use various function modules for data representation. </li>

        <li>Using more features of PHP framework and tools cause poor performance of online applications. </li>
        <li>PHP don’t allow change or modification in core behavior of online applications. </li>
        <li>The PHP frameworks aren’t equivalent in behavior so does their performance and features.</li> 
        <li>While PHP may be a powerful tool supported by an outsized community and plentiful reference documentation, there are easier programming languages for web apps. </li>
